Hi Jessica and Donna,

Thank you for popping those images in. Are there any pngs or jpegs for the logo and watermark as PDF’s are in the dropbox? 

At this stage I am completeing all the paperwork and analysis that comes prior to building the website, so there is no big hurry for images and text yet. It is a bit like building a house – right now I’m drawing up the blueprints and getting all the requirements together. Then I build a foundation and the framework and put in the “plumbing” and “electricity” – which is the functional things that happen when a user clicks on something or wants to login or register etc. The last part will be painting the walls and putting in the furniture – the images, video and text etc. In the meantime I will have what are called placeholders which is the space to put things in.

I should have let you know my limitations as well when we met up – as a student I’ve got four courses at the moment so have a finite time each week for this project so it will be steady but sure, and the set dates for milestones are the deadlines for each part of the development which will come up regularly 😊

I’ll keep in touch and have a look at the quality of the images on Facebook in the weekend and let you know.

Thanks again for your support,

Warm regards,

Di
