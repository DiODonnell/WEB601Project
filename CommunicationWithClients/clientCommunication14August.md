Hi Donna & Jessica,
 
Thanks you so much for meeting with me today and sharing your ideas and vision for the website. I really appreciate that you are both happy to accomodate my requirements for the project and we can get rid of some functionality at the end if that is what you would like.
 
I am proposing to build a website that is responsive, which is that no matter what device the user is on, they will have full functionality and get the same experience. Which you want to be with ease and quickly.
 
The look will be minimalistic following the look of the shop and your Facebook page. Included will be a banner with the image of the shop and the logo. Under that will be a simple menu to the different pages. Below that will be some text “provided by you” that gives the story of “Tula & Niles By Design” and a simple image.
There will be a watermark peeping out from the bottom left corner of the page with roughly 2/3 showing at an angle. 
We will have a login for four types of users : Yourselves with total control, artists submitting work for consideration, artists already approved submitting new work and managing what they have already submitted by communicating with you here, approval = a signed contract with bank account details, buyers will also log in to register interest in purchasing. If two buyers interested in same piece  = auction. 
 
If something of importance happens a notification will be sent to Donnas phone.
 
Typewriter font will be used, this may be adjusted for readibility. Only bold and regular text.
 
I will look at the Trademe freight options as an option for purchasing.
 
Images will be thumbnails which will enlarge when clicked or tapped. Images can be viewed with a horizontal scroll.
 
The site will be very user friendly in that it functions simply, easily and obviously.
 
I will create a dropbox for images and text.
 
I need  “about you” text and images. Text regarding the “shop” and any other text you feel will reflect yourselves, your vision, point of differenc and statements that represent what you want users to feel when visiting your site.
The type of wording to  use for acceptance or denial of submitted art. 
Small bios on the artists work you have in stock. Photos if they agree would be nice.
To review the contract regarding usernames and passwords etc. For security and if and what will happen if they abuse that privilege. 
You will also need a privacy statement if you are holding information as that’s a legal requirement in NZ and you can find templates online.
Images of art and the shop, the logo and watermark.

It’s a lot but just take your time as I will be working on the structure for now with placeholders.
 
It is a work in progress so we can adjust as we go through the stages.
 
 
Thanks again,
 
Warm Regards,
 
Di
